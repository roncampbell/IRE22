# IRE22

This is the repository for an <code>R</code> class at the <code>IRE Conference</code> in Denver on June 23, 2022. A tip sheet, data, and R script are included. 

To get the data, click on the "Branch: main" box next to the "New pull request" box and click on the choice "Data"; you'll then see the CSV files. People using these materials after the conference should have the latest versions of R and R Studio plus the tidyverse and tidycensus packages.
