# IRE22

This is the repository for an <code>R</code> class at the <code>IRE Conference</code> in Denver on June 23, 2022. A tip sheet, R Fundamentals, is included along with data and an R script. 

To get the data and script, click on the "Branch: main" box next to the "New pull request" box and click on the choice "Data"; you'll then see two CSV files and the script, DemoTracts.R. 

The DemoTracts.R script imports, cleans and writes the DenverTracts data frame used in the first part of the class. You can modify the script, substituting your own state and county/counties in the appropriate places to get 2020 census data for your community. People using these materials after the conference should have the latest versions of R and R Studio plus the tidyverse and tidycensus packages.
